The following issues are planned to implement (not ordered by priority):
- cross-validation and use it if regularisation parameter is not provided
- more efficient optimization algorithms and stochastic gradient descent
- dual optimization and kernel functions
- sparse representation of data
- multiclass version
- documentation
- example weights
- feature weights / customized regularisation function (allow arbitrary covariance)
